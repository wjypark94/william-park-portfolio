                            <p className="about-paragraph">  Iâ€™m a software engineer interested in frontend and full-stack development roles. My experience with JavaScript extends across the full-stack spectrum and I enjoy leveraging various libraries and frameworks to create modular components and scalable applications. I relish any opportunity to work with new technologies while obtaining mastery with my other skills. I love to design and code a simple, beautiful user experience with a priority for accessibility. Ultimately, I want to work on bringing inspirational ideas to life.</p>
                            <p className="about-paragraph"> Originally coming from a Pre-Health background, I later realized that programming is my true passion. I regularly draw upon my experience as a physical therapy aide where being resourceful, taking initiative, and encouraging others were all essential keys to building a thriving community and successful production. Through this experience, I learned to love working with a team to come up with the most creative solutions in problem solving. This led me to finding enjoyment in the entire full-stack development process, where I can create frontend user-facing features and work out the backend logic throughout the server, database, and deployment.</p>
